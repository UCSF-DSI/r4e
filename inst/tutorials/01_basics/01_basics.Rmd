## Getting Started

You may have heard that R and RStudio are great tools for doing data science, but do you know what makes them useful? Also, what's the difference between R and RStudio?

## What is R?

**R** is a programming language used frequently for data science and statistical applications.

A **programming language** is a human-interpretable way to provide specific instructions to a computer. There are many programming languages out there, and some examples are Python, Javascript, and C++.

![Programming Language Logos Displayed: R, Python, C++, Java, Julia, Swift](images/programming_languages.png "Programming Languages"){width="100%"}

R is a great option for the following reasons:

-   It is free and open source.
-   There is a large community of R users (many of whom do data science) who provide support for each other.

**R vs Python**

</summary>

Another popular language used for data science and statistical applications is Python. Although this course is R-based, both R and Python are excellent programming languages for beginners to learn.

To determine whether to start with R and Python, we recommend picking the language your friends and colleagues use. That way, they can support you as you are learning!

<br />

***Pro Tip**: Although it is useful to understand multiple programming languages, you should only learn one programming language at a time (especially if you are a beginner). Once you have mastered one programming language, then you can try learning others.*

## What is RStudio?

Now that you know more about R, it's time to learn about RStudio. **RStudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) used to interact with R.

Although you don't have to use one, an **IDE** is a type of software program that makes computer programming easier to do. As you learn more about RStudio, you'll see how some of its features make R programming more enjoyable.

For the most part, you will be doing R programming inside of RStudio. Visit [RStudio's website](https://www.rstudio.com/) to learn more about it.

## Knowledge Check

```{r KC-1, echo=FALSE}
question("TRUE or FALSE: RStudio is a programming language used frequently for data science and statistical applications.",
  answer("TRUE ", message = "Not quite. RStudio is an IDE used to interact with the R programming language."),
  answer("FALSE ", correct = TRUE, message = "That's right! Continue on to the next lesson to launch RStudio."),
  type="single",
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

## Launching RStudio

Let's try launching RStudio. If you haven't already, go ahead and open RStudio on your computer. You should see something like this.

![RStudio Window](images/rstudio_window.png "RStudio Window"){width="100%"}

### RStudio Console

First, let's take a look at the Console on the left side of the window. Inside the **Console**, you can enter R commands. Try entering `1 + 1` inside the Console and then pressing *Enter*.

![The RStudio Console is located at the left side of the RStudio Window.](images/console.png "RStudio Console"){width="100%"}

You can think of the Console as a calculator, and many mathematical operators are built into the R programming language. For example, try entering `2 * 4 - 6 / 2` in the Console.

```{r KC-2, echo=FALSE}
question("What does the Console print after you enter `2 * 4 - 6 / 2`?",
  answer("5", correct = TRUE, message = "You got it! R maintains standard order of operations."),
  answer("1", message = "Not quite. Try again."),
  answer("-2", message = "Not quite. Try again."),
  answer("Something else...", message = "Not quite. Try again."),
  type="single",
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

***Pro Tip**: Inside the Console, you can use the up arrow key to find and re-enter previous commands.*

At this point, the Console is the only RStudio feature you should know about. As you progress through your R learning journey, you'll learn about other RStudio features. If you want to a sneak peek at all the RStudio features available, check out this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf) by the RStudio team.
