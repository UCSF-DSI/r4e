## Getting Started

*Lesson Objective: Index matrices.*

As useful as vectors are, they are 1-dimensional (literally!), and most data isn't. Even with our table of students grades, the data is 2-dimensional (includes both rows and columns).

To work with this data, you can use **matrices** which are rectangular arrays of values. Let's take a look.

## Creating Matrices

Using the `matrix()` function, we can specify the values, number of rows, and number of columns in our matrix.

```{r exercise_02e, exercise=TRUE}
all_grades <- matrix(
  c(80, 90, 85, 85, 90, 90, 85, 100, 85, 95, 65, 70, 80, 75, 75),
  nrow = 5,
  ncol = 3
)

print(all_grades)
```

This isn't always practical, and as you can see above, it's hard to keep track of which values in `c(80, 90, 85, 85, 90, 90, 85, 100, 85, 95, 65, 70, 80, 75, 75)` are assignment 1 grades, assignment 2 grades, and test grades.

A better way to do this is to leverage vectors.

```{r exercise_02f, exercise=TRUE}

assignment1_grades <- c(80, 90, 85, 85, 90)
assignment2_grades <- c(90, 85, 100, 85, 95)
test_grades <- c(65, 70, 80, 75, 75)

all_grades <- cbind(assignment1_grades, assignment2_grades, test_grades)

# display grades
print(all_grades)
```

By using the `cbind()` function, we're able to make each vector a column in our new matrix. Another useful function for combining vectors into matrices is the `rbind()` function which makes each vector a row.

By using vectors to create your matrix, you make your code easier to read. You may have also notices that `cbind()` automatically named the columns of your matrix based on the names of the vectors. Likewise, `rbind()` will name the rows of your matrix based on the vector names. Let's go ahead and name the rows of the `all_grades` matrix using the students' names.

```{r exercise_02gsetup, include=FALSE}

assignment1_grades <- c(80, 90, 85, 85, 90)
assignment2_grades <- c(90, 85, 100, 85, 95)
test_grades <- c(65, 70, 80, 75, 75)

all_grades <- cbind(assignment1_grades, assignment2_grades, test_grades)
```

```{r exercise_02g, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="exercise_02gsetup"}

rownames(all_grades) <- c("Albert", "Enrico", "Ian", "Michelle", "Namari")
colnames(all_grades) <- c("assignment1_grades", "assignment2_grades", "test_grades")

# display grades
print(all_grades)
```

By using the `rownames()` and `colnames()` functions, we can name the rows and columns of our matrices. This makes it easier to index values in your matrix.

## Indexing Matrices

Indexing matrices is very similar to indexing vectors, and you will use square brackets (`[ ]`) as well. However, unlike vectors, you have to index both the rows and columns of a matrix. Let's take a look at a few examples.

```{r exercise_02hsetup, include=FALSE}

assignment1_grades <- c(80, 90, 85, 85, 90)
assignment2_grades <- c(90, 85, 100, 85, 95)
test_grades <- c(65, 70, 80, 75, 75)

all_grades <- cbind(assignment1_grades, assignment2_grades, test_grades)

rownames(all_grades) <- c("Albert", "Enrico", "Ian", "Michelle", "Namari")
colnames(all_grades) <- c("assignment1_grades", "assignment2_grades", "test_grades")
```

```{r exercise_02h, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="exercise_02hsetup"}

# Select all columns in the first row
print(all_grades[1, ])

# Select all rows in the second column
print(all_grades[, 2])

# Select Albert, Enrico, and Namari's assignment 1 and assignment 2 grades
print(
  all_grades[
    c("Albert", "Enrico", "Namari"),
    c("assignment1_grades", "assignment2_grades")
  ]
)
```

Here are some key observations based on the examples:

-   The square brackets all follow the form of `[row_indices, column_indices]`.

-   Both row and column indices are vectors

-   To select all rows or all columns, you still need to include the comma, and you would leave out either the row indices or column indices based on what you are selecting.

-   You can index using integers (based on position within matrix) or row/column names.

Similar to vectors, you can also use logic (vector of boolean values) to index matrices.

```{r exercise_02i, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="exercise_02hsetup"}

# Select rows where assignment 2 grade was 90 or above (include all columns)
print(
  all_grades[all_grades[, "assignment2_grades"] >= 90, ]
)
```

## Knowledge Check

Write some code based on the description below:

    Index the `all_grades` matrix and include only students who scored 85 or above on assignment 1 and 90 or above on assignment 2. Store the results in an object called `high_achievers` and print the results. As a bonus, try modifying `high_achievers` so it only contains the student names.

    Hint: Your results should be the same as the previous Knowledge Check's results.

| student  | assignment1_grade | assignment2_grade | test_grade |
|:---------|:------------------|:------------------|:-----------|
| Albert   | 80                | 90                | 65         |
| Enrico   | 90                | 85                | 70         |
| Ian      | 85                | 100               | 80         |
| Michelle | 85                | 85                | 75         |
| Namari   | 90                | 95                | 75         |

You can reveal the solution once you are comfortable with your response

```{r KC2b, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=10, exercise.setup="exercise_02hsetup"}
# YOUR WORK HERE

# Index the `all_grades` matrix and include only students who scored 85 or above on assignment 1 and 90 or above on assignment 2. Store the results in an object called `high_achievers`.


# As a bonus, try modifying `high_achievers` so it only contains the student names.


# Print `high_achievers`


```

```{r KC2b-solution}

# Index the `all_grades` matrix and include only students who scored 85 or above on assignment 1 and 90 or above on assignment 2. Store the results in an object called `high_achievers`.
high_achievers <- all_grades[
  all_grades[, "assignment1_grades"] >= 85 & all_grades[, "assignment2_grades"] >= 90,
]
# As a bonus, try modifying `high_achievers` so it only contains the student names.
high_achievers <- rownames(high_achievers)

# Print `high_achievers`
print(high_achievers)

```
