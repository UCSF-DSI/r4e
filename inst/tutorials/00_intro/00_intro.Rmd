## Course Overview

Want to learn computer programming but don't know where to start? You're
in the right place! R for Everyone is a friendly introduction to R, and
you will learn basic computer programming with R. The topics we'll cover
are:

1.  R and RStudio

2.  Computer Programming

3.  Objects

4.  Conditions

5.  Loops

6.  Functions

7.  Vectors

8.  Matrices

9.  Data Frames

### Prerequisites

This course is designed for beginners, and there are no pre-requisites.
However, you'll need to have some software installed:

-   [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
-   [Install
    RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Chances are, if you're viewing this course, you already have these
installed. However, if that is not the case, take a moment to install
both R and RStudio on your computer (both macOS and Windows are fine),
and we'll discuss what these are later! If you already have these
installed, you are good to go!
